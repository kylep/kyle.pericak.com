## About This Site

This here's my technology blog.

It's intended to serve a few purposes:

1. Help other people solve problems I've ran into, particularly ones that were
   hard to google.
1. Save my notes in an easy to reference format
1. Showcase the cool stuff I've worked with
1. Encourage me to keep learning new things

## About the Author

My name's Kyle Pericak, and I'm a technological jack-of-all-trades working
around the Toronto, Canada area.

I've spent the last few years building OpenStack based private clouds for
[Breqwatr](https://breqwatr.com), where I lead the development team.

Before that I built custom one-off clouds as a professional services
consultant. Around then I also spent some time automating every-day IT jobs,
mostly around Toronto's banks and insurance companies. Even further back I
wrote Java VOIP applications. I've also ran a web development company briefly,
worked tech support, been a Chief Security Officer for a small MSP, and worn
god-knows how many other hats.

My main focus lately has been around hybrid clouds, DevOps, and
Python application development.

I'm particularly interested in doing more work around site reliability,
DevSecOps, and having more customer interactions.

Outside of work, I'm a father to two boys, a husband, a bad musician, and
when time allows I enjoy board games and strategy video games. I listen to a
**lot** of audiobooks, and lately podcasts too.

I love learning new things.
