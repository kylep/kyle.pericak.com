## About This Site

This here's my technology blog.

It's intended to serve a few purposes:

1. Help other people solve problems I've ran into, particularly ones that were
   hard to google.
1. Save my notes in an easy to reference format
1. Showcase the cool stuff I've worked with
1. Encourage me to keep learning new things

## About the Author

My name's Kyle Pericak. I work in the Toronto area.
I focus mainly on hybrid cloud and DevOps technologies.

Right now I'm leading the dev team and building
private clouds with a consumerized web UI for a company called [Breqwatr](https://breqwatr.com).

I'm particularly interested in site reliability, information security, and
customer interactions.

Outside of work, I'm a father to two boys, a husband, a bad musician, and
when time allows I enjoy strategy video games. I listen to a **lot** of
audibooks, and lately podcasts too. I love learning new things.
