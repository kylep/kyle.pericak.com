At a high level, the steps to upload a package to PyPi are as follows:

1. Write the project code
1. Create a release on GitHub and put it in the `download_url` of setup.py
1. Write a setup.py file to build and describe the project
1. Write a setup.cfg file pointing to the readme
1. create a source distribution


# Write the project code


I'm not going to cover how to build a python project in this post, but here's
the very small and simple project I used when learning this procedure:
[GitHub: kylep/jsc2f](https://github.com/kylep/jsc2f).

# Create a Release on GitHub

Log into your GitHub project and click on releases. If you can't find the link,
you can also just append `/releases` to the end of the URL to get there.

Click "Create a new release". Enter your tag and branch, along with a release
title and description.

Under the Assets section of the new release there's a (tar.gz) link to download
the source code. If you right click it and copy the URL, that's used next in
the setup.py file.

# Write a setup.py file

Here's mine. Check GitHub to see if I've changed it.
The `download_url` value comes from the GitHub release.

```python
from setuptools import setup

# Without this you'll get no description on the pypi site
with open("README.md", "r") as fh:
    long_description = fh.read()

setup(
    name='jsc2f',
    packages=['jsc2f'], # Alternatively you can use find_packages()
    version='0.1', # match the github release you make later
    license='MIT', # match the LICENSE file in the project
    description='Saves a JSON fields SQLs cell to a file, or UPDATE it back',
    author='Kyle Pericak',
    author_email='kyle@pericak.com',
    url='kyle.pericak.com/jsc2f', # either your own page or github
    download_url='https://github.com/kylep/jsc2f/archive/v0.1.tar.gz',
    keywords=['SQL', 'JSON', 'file'],
    install_requires=[
        'click',
        'mysql-connector'
    ],
    entry_points='''
        [console_scripts]
        jsc2f=jsc2f.cli:cli
    ''',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',
        'Intended Audience :: Information Technology',
        'Topic :: Database',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Natural Language :: English'

```


## Picking a topic:

I used [this classifier list](https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers)

# Write setup.cfg

This goes in the project root next to setup.py.

`vi setup.cfg`

```ini
[metadata]
description-file = README.md
```



# Creating a source distribution

For this you use the python [sdist](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html)
tool and [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/).

From the git project root:

```bash
pip install twine

# This will create dist/
python setup.py sdist

# Twine uploads the dist/ files to Pypi
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*
# Enter your username and password for PyPI
```
