# What is Pelican

[Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) is a free and open source
static website generator. It takes a collection of files
written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as its input,
applies a theme and configuration, then outputs a full static website.

A static website is a collection of HTML and CSS files that don't need any
database or back-end programming language. These websites can be hosted by any
web-server regardless of language support.

# Creating a Pelican Project

While not necessary, its a really good idea to make a git project to source
control your blog content.

The project will hold the configuration for Pelican, which defines the plugins,
variables for the style-sheet, and the site name. This project also holds all
the markdown files which make up the blog content.

## Project Layout

The files should be placed in a structure as follows.

- Configuration goes in the `pelicanconf.py` file.
- Blog posts go in `content/posts`, and can be sorted into subdirectories.
  The nested directory structure has no impact on how the site is rendered.
- Static pages go in `content/pages`. These are handled specially by the
  templating engine.
- `content/images` stores image files
- `output/` doesn't need to exist here, but it's used by the `-o` (output)
  argument in Pelican as the directory to store the generated website files.
  This directory should be ignored by Git.

# Pelican & Markdown Syntax Reference

## Post Metadata

The top of each post starts with some metadata that Pelican uses to scaffold
the site.

```text
title: Title of the post or page
summary: Detailed summary
slug: short-name-goes-in-the-url
category: whereThisWillBeSorted
tags: tag1, tag2
date: 2019-08-28
modified: 2019-08-28
status: published or draft
```

- `title`: defines the string at the top of the article and in the index
- `summary`: used in the index pages. If not defined, a large and
somewhat ugly subset of the top part of your post will auto-populate this
field.
- `slug`: defines the URL from which the post page is accessible
- `category`: place this post into a category, accessible from the sidebar in
  this particular theme.
- `tags`: a comma delimited list of indexed sub-categories. Can have many.
- `date`: When the page was authored
- `modified`: When the page was last changed
- `status`: either `published` or `draft`. Defines whether the page is ready to
   be displayed to the public.

You can also define custom attributes to use in your themes. I've modified a
theme to allow custom thumbnail files for the index and a blog image which look
like this:

```text
image: pelican.png
thumbnail: pelican-thumb.png
```

## Headers
```text
Regular text
# Big header (h1)
## Smaller Header (h2)
### Even smaller header
```

## Horizontal Line
```text
---
```

## Table of Contents
**Note**: A plugin must be enabled for this feature.
[See here](https://github.com/tessgi/TessGiWebsite/tree/master/plugins/extract_toc).

```text
[TOC]
```

## Numbered List
The numbers will automatically increment.
```text
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third Item
```

## Bullet List
```text
- First Item
- Second Item
    - Nested List item with 4 spaces before the dash
- Third Item
```

## HTML
Markdown files can also support raw HTML content, allowing you a lot of
flexibility.

```html
<table class="mytable>
  <tr><th>Header</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Cell</td></td></tr>
</table>
```

## Links

Linked text goes in square brackets the URL in round brackets.
```text
[A web link](https://example.com)
```

## Images

# Preview the Site

The content is ready to be converted into a website. Use a Pelican container to
generate the site. The pelican container can also act as a local web server to
preview changes before pushing them.

## Pull the Pelican Image
Pull a pelican image from GCR or Docker Hub.
Mine is `gcr.io/kylepericak/pelican` on GCR and `kpericak/pelican` on Docker
Hub. The GCR image is private, since they charge me for the downloads.

```bash
docker pull gcr.io/kylepericak/pelican
# or
docker pull kpericak/pelican
```

## Launch the Pelican container
Run this from the project root. It will mount the content/ and output/
directories into a new container named "pelican". It will also forward the
port Pelican's web server listens on (8000) to the workstation's port 8888.

The Pelican auto-reload feature looks like maybe its multithreaded or something,
so running it as the root process of the docker container doesn't work.
Instead, launch the container with the `tail -f /dev/null` command so it just
idles.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pelican \
  -v $(pwd)/content:/content \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  -p 8888:8000 \
  gcr.io/kylepericak/pelican \
  tail -f /dev/null
```

## Launch the local web server and auto-rebuild service
This will build the site files, launch the web server, and watch for new
file changes so it can automatically rebuild.

The example `docker exec` command runs interactively. I like to run it in a
 dedicated tmux pane to show if anything has gone wrong.

```bash
docker exec -it pelican \
  pelican \
    -s /pelicanconf.py \
    --debug \
    --autoreload \
    --listen \
    /content \
    -o /output
```
