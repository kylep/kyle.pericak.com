**This project is a "Deep Dive":** In a Deep Dive project I'll be investigating
as much about the subject as time allows and assembling the posts in some
orderly fashion. I'll also be writing high-level notes and opinions in the
project page itself.


In this project I'll be trying out each of the Google Cloud Platform's
services. I'll be updating it pretty regularly.
